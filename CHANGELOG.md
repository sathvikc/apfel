## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- An unknown `x_context_strategy` value (e.g. `sliding-window` typo'd as `sliding_window`) now returns `400 invalid_request_error` listing the valid values, instead of silently falling back to `newest-first` while the caller believes their strategy is active. The sibling `x_context_max_turns`/`x_context_output_reserve` params were already strictly validated (#237).
- The OpenAI error object now always includes `param` and `code` (explicit `null` when absent), so router/proxy front-ends that branch on `error.code` see the key. An unknown `model` now returns `404` with `code: "model_not_found"` and `param: "model"` (OpenAI parity) instead of `400` with the keys omitted (#236).
- `top_p` outside `[0, 1]` and `temperature` above `2` now return `400 invalid_request_error` instead of passing through to FoundationModels and surfacing as an opaque `500`. The existing `temperature < 0` check is unchanged; OpenAI caps `temperature` at 2 and requires `top_p` in `[0, 1]` (#235).
- A `/v1/chat/completions` request body over 1 MiB now returns `413` with an OpenAI error object, CORS headers, and a request-log entry, instead of a bare `413` with `Content-Length: 0` (no error object, unreadable by browser clients, unlogged). The over-limit `collect` error is caught inside the handler and returned as a normal response so the CORS middleware and request logger both run (#234).
- Empty or null `content` in the last (non-tool) user message of a `/v1/chat/completions` request now returns `400 invalid_request_error` ("The last message must have non-empty 'content'") instead of `500 server_error`. A missing prompt is a client-input problem, not a server fault (#233).
- Streaming requests that fail before the SSE body is built (validation failure, bad `json_schema`, context-build failure) no longer leak a concurrency permit and an `active_requests` count. Previously `--max-concurrent` (default 5) malformed `"stream": true` requests permanently exhausted server capacity - a remote unauthenticated DoS. Cleanup is now keyed on an explicit `ownsCleanup` trace flag set only by live SSE stream responses, instead of on the requested `stream` value (#213).
- A request that waits the full 30s for a concurrency permit no longer crashes the whole server with SIGABRT ("freed pointer was not the last allocation"); it now gets the intended 429. The semaphore timeout task no longer uses the clock-based `Task.sleep(for:)` (which aborted the task allocator on resume under the server executor) and is now stored on the actor and cancelled by `signal()` when a permit is handed over. `AsyncSemaphore` moved into `ApfelCore` for unit-test coverage (#214).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `apfel --count-tokens` - zero-inference token-budget preflight. Reports how many tokens a prompt would consume before calling the on-device model, broken down by prompt/system/file/MCP component against the context budget. Accepts the same inputs as prompt mode (stdin, `-f`, `-s`, `--system-file`, `--mcp`), supports `-o json` for a machine-readable breakdown, and `--strict` (exit 4 when over budget). Runs even when Apple Intelligence is unavailable via a chars/4 fallback (`approximate: true`) (#207).

### Fixed

- Tap formula no longer prints Homebrew 6's `depends_on :macos` with `depends_on macos:` runtime deprecation on every `brew` operation. The macOS version floor moved into an `on_macos` block (as Homebrew's deprecation message prescribes) while the bare top-level `depends_on :macos` - the only hard Linux block for the prebuilt-binary tap - is preserved (#206).
- `message_text_content` benchmark no longer flakes the release preflight. It is a single-pass correctness refactor with no reliably measurable speedup, so the performance test now validates its output rather than asserting a wall-clock speedup ratio it cannot stably deliver.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `apfel demos [dir]` writes the bundled demo scripts (cmd, explain, oneliner, wtd, naming, port, gitsum, mac-narrator) to a directory. The demos are embedded in the binary, so it behaves identically on homebrew-core, the tap, and source builds (#204).

### Changed

- CHANGELOG.md is now backfilled through every release and kept current automatically by the release workflow (#201).

### Fixed

- Tap formula keeps its macOS-only guard: silence the `Homebrew/OSDependsOn` style warning without dropping `depends_on :macos`, which is the only hard Linux block for the prebuilt-binary tap (#203).

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Blank line in MCP reader leftover no longer stalls into a timeout.

- String-aware brace scan + bounded CLI re-detection (#178).
- Fallback token counter counts tool definitions and tool-call args (#176).
- Unknown `GenerationError` case classifies to `.unknown`, not a locale keyword guess (#181).
- `SchemaParser` throws on non-dictionary property schema instead of silently dropping it (#180).
- Env vars and `--retry` enforce the same validation as their flags (#177).
- `JSONFenceStripper.strip` returns trimmed content when no fence present (#183).
