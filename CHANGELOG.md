# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A request that waits the full 30s for a concurrency permit no longer crashes the whole server with SIGABRT ("freed pointer was not the last allocation"); it now gets the intended 429. The semaphore timeout task no longer uses the clock-based `Task.sleep(for:)` (which aborted the task allocator on resume under the server executor) and is now stored on the actor and cancelled by `signal()` when a permit is handed over. `AsyncSemaphore` moved into `ApfelCore` for unit-test coverage (#214).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `apfel --count-tokens` - zero-inference token-budget preflight. Reports how many tokens a prompt would consume before calling the on-device model, broken down by prompt/system/file/MCP component against the context budget. Accepts the same inputs as prompt mode (stdin, `-f`, `-s`, `--system-file`, `--mcp`), supports `-o json` for a machine-readable breakdown, and `--strict` (exit 4 when over budget). Runs even when Apple Intelligence is unavailable via a chars/4 fallback (`approximate: true`) (#207).

### Fixed

- Tap formula no longer prints Homebrew 6's `depends_on :macos` with `depends_on macos:` runtime deprecation on every `brew` operation. The macOS version floor moved into an `on_macos` block (as Homebrew's deprecation message prescribes) while the bare top-level `depends_on :macos` - the only hard Linux block for the prebuilt-binary tap - is preserved (#206).
- `message_text_content` benchmark no longer flakes the release preflight. It is a single-pass correctness refactor with no reliably measurable speedup, so the performance test now validates its output rather than asserting a wall-clock speedup ratio it cannot stably deliver.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `apfel demos [dir]` writes the bundled demo scripts (cmd, explain, oneliner, wtd, naming, port, gitsum, mac-narrator) to a directory. The demos are embedded in the binary, so it behaves identically on homebrew-core, the tap, and source builds (#204).

### Changed

- CHANGELOG.md is now backfilled through every release and kept current automatically by the release workflow (#201).

### Fixed

- Tap formula keeps its macOS-only guard: silence the `Homebrew/OSDependsOn` style warning without dropping `depends_on :macos`, which is the only hard Linux block for the prebuilt-binary tap (#203).

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

### Changed

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Blank line in MCP reader leftover no longer stalls into a timeout.
