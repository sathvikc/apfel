## Your job

Check whether apfel's three distribution channels are in sync. If any channel is lagging by more than 48 hours, open a GitHub issue on `Arthur-Ficial/apfel` with the information Franz needs to fix it in one command. You do not fix anything yourself.

### The three channels you check

| Channel | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| **GitHub Releases** (the upstream that the other two feed from) | `gh release view --repo Arthur-Ficial/apfel` latest tag, published-at |
| **homebrew-core** (`brew install apfel`) | `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/master/Formula/a/apfel.rb` - look for the `version` / `url` fields |
| **nixpkgs** (`nix profile install nixpkgs#apfel-llm`) | `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/master/pkgs/by-name/ap/apfel-llm/package.nix` - look for the `version` field |

### Step-by-step

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** and `docs/release.md` to stay current on the distribution story.

2. **Fetch the canonical version** from the latest GitHub Release:
   ```bash
   gh release view --repo Arthur-Ficial/apfel --json tagName,publishedAt
   ```

3. **Fetch the homebrew-core formula** and parse its version:
   ```bash
   curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/master/Formula/a/apfel.rb | grep -E 'version|url'
   ```

4. **Fetch the nixpkgs package** and parse its version:
   ```bash
   curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/master/pkgs/by-name/ap/apfel-llm/package.nix | grep -E 'version|hash'
   ```

5. **Check for in-flight bump PRs.** Before computing lag, verify no bump PR is already open upstream. A channel is **not lagging** if a maintainer-side PR exists targeting the canonical version:

   ```bash
   # nixpkgs - title format: "apfel-llm: <old> -> <new>"
   gh search prs --repo NixOS/nixpkgs --state open "apfel-llm in:title" --json title,number,createdAt

   # homebrew-core - title format: "apfel <version>"
   gh search prs --repo Homebrew/homebrew-core --state open "apfel in:title" --json title,number,createdAt
   ```

   If any open PR's title contains the canonical version (or a higher one), treat that channel as **in flight, not lagging**. Don't open an issue for it. Note in your reasoning that PR #<N> is in the queue.

   This guard exists because nixpkgs review queues can sit on a bump for 1-2 weeks; the bump tooling has already done its job and there is nothing for Franz to fix on his side.

6. **Compute lag** for any channel that is NOT in flight:
   - Time since the GitHub Release was published (use `publishedAt`)
   - Current version in that channel vs. canonical

   A channel is "lagging" if it is at a version older than the canonical AND the canonical release is more than 48 hours old AND no bump PR is in flight upstream.

7. **If no lag, do nothing.** The routine budget is precious. Log nothing, open nothing, comment nothing. Exit clean.

8. **If there is lag on one or both channels** (and no bump PR is in flight upstream), open ONE issue (not two) summarizing the state and suggesting commands. Template below.

### Issue template

Title format: `dist-sync: <channel> behind v<canonical> by <N>h`

Body (short, Arthur voice):

```
Routine check this morning - looks like <channel(s)> are trailing the latest release.

## State

| Channel | Current | Expected | Lag |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Releases | v<canonical> | - | - |
| homebrew-core | v<hb-current> | v<canonical> | ~<N>h |
| nixpkgs `apfel-llm` | <nix-current> | <canonical> | ~<N>h |

## Fixing it (for you, not me)

**Homebrew-core:** normally autobumps within ~24h. If it is stuck, manually:

\```bash
brew bump-formula-pr apfel \
  --url=https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel/releases/download/v<canonical>/apfel-<canonical>-arm64-macos.tar.gz \
  --sha256=<sha256>
\```

(SHA256 from the release asset: `<computed-sha256>`)

**nixpkgs:** `make release` opens a `NixOS/nixpkgs` PR automatically as its final step (`scripts/publish-nixpkgs-bump.sh`). If the channel is lagging anyway, the local bump didn't fire (release cut on a machine without `gh` logged in, or it failed silently). Re-run on demand:

\```bash
./scripts/publish-nixpkgs-bump.sh --version <canonical>
\```

`r-ryantm` is the safety net (~weekly) if you don't.

## What I did NOT do

No bump PRs, no pushes, no formula edits. Routines never touch distribution channels - that's yours.

Cheers, Arthur

### De-duplication

Before opening a new issue, check for an existing open dist-sync issue:

```bash
gh issue list --repo Arthur-Ficial/apfel --state open --search "dist-sync" --json number,title
```

If one already exists for the same canonical version, **update** it with a comment rather than opening a duplicate:

```
Still not in sync as of <today>. Same state as the issue body, channels still at <hb-current> / <nix-current>. No action taken on my end.

Cheers, Arthur
```

### Hard limits - repeat

- Never run `brew bump-formula-pr`, never push to `Arthur-Ficial/homebrew-tap`.
- Never run a manual nixpkgs bump from the routine - point Franz at `scripts/publish-nixpkgs-bump.sh --version <canonical>` (which he runs locally), with the manual self-bump in [docs/nixpkgs.md](../../docs/nixpkgs.md) as recovery.
- Never create PRs against homebrew-core or nixpkgs from this routine.
- Never edit the formula or package.nix.
- Never close any issue.
- Fetch only public endpoints - no authenticated reads of the tap from this routine.

### Exit criteria

You are done when one of:
- No lag detected (or all lagging channels have an upstream bump PR in flight) - exit clean, no output.
- Lag detected, no existing open issue - one new issue opened with the template above.
- Lag detected, existing open issue - one comment added with the still-not-in-sync note.

### If something goes wrong

- Homebrew formula URL 404s (file moved to a different letter directory or renamed) - post the issue anyway, note in the body that automatic checks need updating, `cc @franzenzenhofer`.
- nixpkgs master temporarily unreachable - skip this run, do not open an issue about connectivity. Next Monday will try again.
- Canonical GitHub Release tag is a pre-release or draft - skip this run entirely.
